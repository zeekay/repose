Manage ``git`` and ``mercurial`` repositories simultaneously.
=============================================================

``repose`` provides a few different tools to make managing ``git`` and 
``mercurial`` repositories simultaneously eaiser. You can setup a central 
repo to push to, and using hooks can push from there to bitbucket and
github automatically. Use the tool you prefer, share with all.

Note
====
Documentation lacking, but I'll be getting to work on that quickly.
Any help is welcome.

You can message me through github/bitbucket or catch me on ``irc.freenode.net``
