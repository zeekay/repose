``repose`` -- tools for working with mercurial and git repositories
===================================================================

    Manage ``git`` and ``mercurial`` repositories simultaneously.

.. note::

    Documentation lacking, but I'll be getting to work on that quickly.
    Any help is welcome.

``repose`` provides a few different tools to make managing ``git`` and 
``mercurial`` repositories simultaneously eaiser. You can setup a central 
repo to push to, and using hooks can push from there to bitbucket and
github automatically. Use the tool you prefer, share with all.

You can message me through github/bitbucket or catch me on ``irc.freenode.net`` 
and ``irc.esper.net``.
